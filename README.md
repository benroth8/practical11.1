# Findings

After analyzing data from historical used car sales and creating a model to predict the price of a used car, I've identified some key points you can use to tune your inventory. The most important features when it comes to predicting the price of a used car are - Manufacturer, Title Status, Transmission, Size, and odometer ^ 2.

## Manufacturer
Obviously the manufacturer of a car will have a lot to do with its price, both new and used. In general, higher end car manufacturers will resale for more.

## Title Status
People like a car with a clean title. These cars sell for way more than cars with any other title status.

## Transmission 
Automatic cars tend to sell for more than cars with manual transmission or other types. However, this could simply be due to the fact that cars with manual transmissions tend to be older than new cars which are almost all automatic transmission.

## Size 
Bigger cars sell for more. The average used car price based on size of car going from highest to lowest is - full-size, mid-size, sub-compact, and compact

## Odometer ^ 2
The number of miles on a car is a big indicator of how much it will sell for. The sale price has a exponential relationship with the number of miles the car has.

In conclusion, you should try to have cars made by quality manufacturers, with clean titles, automatic transmission, preferably bigger cars, and with low mileage.
